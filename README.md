This example demonstrates how to write a simple stack machine.
It reads a sequence of operation codes, more commonly called opCodes, which it then interprets in a simple loop.

PUSH 2 to stack
PUSH 3 to stack
pop 2 and 3 from stack; PUSH their sum 5 back to stack
STOP POP THE VALUE FOUND IN STACK (5)
